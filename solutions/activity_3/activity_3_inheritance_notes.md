# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Note-taking

## Pillar 3:  Inheritance
Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming languages. It is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.

### **Declare an inheritance hierarchy**

In Java, each class can only be derived from  one other class. That class is called a superclass, or parent class. The derived class is called subclass, or child class.

You use the keyword  _extends_  to identify the class that your subclass extends. If you don’t declare a superclass, your class implicitly extends the class  _Object_.  _Object_  is the root of all inheritance hierarchies; it’s the only class in Java that doesn’t extend another class.

The following diagram and code snippets show an example of a simple inheritance hierarchy.
